###### Notes
This library is a work in progress for my own personal use currently.
Features will be added as I feel the need or desire for them.

*Currently* it is built specifically for the inkyPHAT display, but soon will support a configuration file to choose display and rotations.

Weather information is currently supported for pulling from OpenWeatherMap.
